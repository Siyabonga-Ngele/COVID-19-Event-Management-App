## Problem 

Currently there is no electronic database system in place to monitor events during pandemics.We currently make use of pen- andpaper-systems for capturing and storing data. Subsequently, there are no automated process of said data in place. Currently employees have to manually sift through thousands of data entrees to order, manipulate and eventually relay the information back to their supervisors. 

The following processes needto be automated:
* Capturing and manipulation of Employee details.
* Capturing and manipulation of Event details.
* Capturing and manipulation of Attendee details.
* The system must be able tomanipulate the given data and ultimately generate reports to show thefollowing:
  * Event name, date and location.
  * Which employees worked at the event alongside how many hours each employee worked.
  * Total attendance, average temperature ofattendees (showing any outliers), showing amount of attendees previously in contact with covid-19.

These reports aim to enableevent organizers to predict possible health risks involved during the event andto subsequently inform attendees of this possibility. Aiming to limit thespread of covid-19 after the event has concluded.

## This app would help to keep events safe and minimize the spread of COVID-19 by:

- Tracking the attendance of event attendees. This would help to identify any potential exposure risks and allow for contact tracing if necessary.
- Assigning employees to events. This would help to ensure that there are enough staff on hand to manage the event and provide assistance to attendees if needed.
- Collecting the medical information of attendees. This would help to determine the risk level of the event and identify any attendees who may be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19.
- Determining the risk level of the event. This would be based on a number of factors, including the number of attendees, the type of event, and the medical information of attendees.
